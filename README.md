# Assignment-for-Business-Analyst
This project was submitted as part of the selection process for the Business Analyst Intern role at Jar. It includes a complete data-driven analysis of sales performance, target evaluation, regional insights, and product recommendations based on the provided datasets and app experience.


# Objective:-
- The objective of this project is to make evidence-based suggestions by conducting an
exhaustive analysis of Jar's sales performance, assessing the usability of the app from a
user-experience perspective, and making strategic product improvement suggestions based
on user requirements and company growth.
# Purpose:-
- The primary purpose of this analysis is to:
- Measure sales and profit performance across categories
- Examine alignment between targets and actual performance
- Identify regional patterns in order volume and profitability
- Recommend optimizations in pricing, inventory, and forecasting


# Key Focus Areas
1. Sales & Profitability Analysis:- 
Merged datasets on Order ID to compute total sales, profit, average profit/order, and profit margins by category.
Identified top-performing (Electronics) and underperforming (Clothing) segments.

2. Target Achievement Analysis (Furniture Category):- 
Performed month-over-month (MoM) % change analysis on target data.
Suggested data-driven forecasting techniques for improved accuracy.

3. Regional Performance Analysis:- 
Highlighted top 5 states by order volume and calculated total sales and average profit.
Detected profitability gaps in high-volume regions (e.g., Gujarat).

5. Jar App Review & Product Strategy:-

Evaluated app features and user experience.
Proposed new offerings like micro SIPs, goal-based savings, and micro-insurance.

# Conclusion
- This project delivered an in-depth analysis of Jar's sales performance, target attainment, and app usability. From Python analysis, we highlighted high-performing categories such as Electronics and poor-performing categories such as Clothing, suggested data-driven forecasting for Furniture targets, and surfaced regional profitability differences. App assessment demonstrated high levels of automation and ease of use, as well as areas for product diversification and better support. Strategic additions such as micro SIPs, goal-based saving, and micro-insurance can take Jar from a gold-savings app to a full-fledged personal finance platform. Capitalizing on its strengths—automation, ease, and trust—Jar can scale in a sustainable way while widening financial access for millions of
Indians.
